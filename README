A cross-platform console-based flash tool for NXP/Jennic microcontrollers. No
tool is currently available for Linux, so I wrote one myself.

This software requires my1termu project for serial port interface module.
Basic console interface codes are also provided by my1termu.

Only tested on JN5148 devices for now.
